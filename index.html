		<p>&bull; <strong> Abstract: </strong> We address the task of open-world class-agnostic object detection, i.e., detecting every object in an image by learning from a limited number of base object classes. State-of-the-art RGB-based models suffer from overfitting the training classes and often fail at detecting novel-looking objects. This is because RGB-based models primarily rely on appearance similarity to detect novel objects and are also prone to overfitting short-cut cues such as textures and discriminative parts. To address these shortcomings of RGB-based object detectors, we propose incorporating geometric cues such as depth and normals, predicted by general-purpose monocular estimators. Specifically, we use the geometric cues to train an object proposal network for pseudo-labeling unannotated novel objects in the training set. Our resulting Geometry-guided Open-world Object Detector (GOOD) significantly improves detection recall for novel object categories and already performs well with only a few training classes. Using a single "person" class for training on the COCO dataset, GOOD surpasses SOTA methods by 5.0% AR@100, a relative improvement of 24%.. <br>

		<p>&bull; <strong> Abstract: </strong> With recent progress in joint modeling of visual and textual representations, Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved impressive performance on many multimodal downstream tasks. However, the requirement for expensive annotations including clean image captions and regional labels limits the scalability of existing approaches, and complicates the pretraining procedure with the introduction of multiple dataset-specific objectives. In this work, we relax these constraints and present a minimalist pretraining framework, named Simple Visual Language Model (SimVLM). Unlike prior work, SimVLM reduces the training complexity by exploiting large-scale weak supervision, and is trained end-to-end with a single prefix language modeling objective. Without utilizing extra data or task-specific customization, the resulting model significantly outperforms previous pretraining methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of discriminative and generative vision-language benchmarks, including VQA (+3.74% vqa-score), NLVR2 (+1.17% accuracy), SNLI-VE (+1.37% accuracy) and image captioning tasks (+10.1% average CIDEr score). Furthermore, we demonstrate that SimVLM acquires strong generalization and transfer ability, enabling zero-shot behavior including open-ended visual question answering and cross-modality transfer. <br>

     <em>3. Long-Short Temporal Modeling for Efficient Action Recognition</em><br>

		<p>&bull; <strong> Abstract: </strong> Efficient long-short temporal modeling is key for enhancing the performance of action recognition
			task. In this paper, we propose a new two-stream action recognition network, termed as MENet, consisting of a Motion 
			Enhancement (ME) module and a Video-level Aggregation (VLA) module to achieve long-short temporal modeling. Specifically, 
			motion representations have been proved effective in capturing short-term and high-frequency action. However, current motion 
			representations are calculated from adjacent frames, which may have poor interpretation and bring useless information (noisy or 
			blank). Thus, for short-term motions, we design an efficient ME module to enhance the short-term motions by mingling the motion 
			saliency among neighboring segments. As for long-term aggregations, VLA is adopted at the top of the appearance branch to 
			integrate the long-term dependencies across all segments. The two components of MENet are complementary in temporal modeling.
			Extensive experiments are conducted on UCF101 and HMDB51 benchmarks, which verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed 
			MENet. <br>
